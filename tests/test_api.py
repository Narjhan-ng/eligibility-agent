Integration tests for FastAPI REST API endpoints.

These tests verify that the API endpoints work correctly,
including request validation, response format, and error handling.

We use FastAPI's TestClient which allows testing the API without
actually running a server - it simulates HTTP requests in-process.

Note: Agent tests (requiring Anthropic API key) are mocked to avoid
making real API calls during testing.
